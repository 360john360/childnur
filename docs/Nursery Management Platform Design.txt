Architectural Blueprint and Strategic Market Analysis for a Sovereign, Multi-Tenant Nursery Management Platform
1. Market and Competitor Scan (UK-Relevant)
The United Kingdom's early years education sector serves as a sophisticated, high-stakes marketplace for software solutions, driven by a confluence of regulatory pressures, parental expectations for digital transparency, and complex government funding models. The market for Nursery Management Software (NMS) has evolved rapidly from localized, desktop-based administrative tools to comprehensive, cloud-native SaaS ecosystems that integrate financial management with pedagogical tracking. However, despite the maturity of the sector, significant friction points remain regarding cost transparency, user experience (UX) fragmentation, and the adaptability of platforms to the nuances of UK-specific "stretched" funding and safeguarding regulations.
1.1 Leading Platform Analysis
The current landscape is dominated by a quadrant of key players—Famly, Connect Childcare, Blossom Educational, and Tapestry—each occupying distinct strategic territories ranging from "community-first" engagement to "enterprise-grade" administration. Understanding their architectural choices, pricing strategies, and user reception provides the critical baseline for designing a disruptive, zero-license-cost alternative.
Famly: The UX and Collaboration Benchmark
Famly positions itself not merely as management software but as an "Early Childhood Platform," distinguishing its brand through a focus on collaboration over pure administration.
* Core Value Proposition: Famly’s architecture prioritizes the "parent partnership," utilizing a social-media-style newsfeed that mimics Facebook or Instagram.1 This design choice lowers the cognitive load for parents and practitioners, fostering high engagement rates.
* Key Modules: The platform integrates child development observations, accident logging, and invoicing into a unified interface. A standout feature is its in-app messaging and translation capabilities, which address the increasing linguistic diversity in UK urban centres.2
* Pricing Strategy: Famly operates on a tiered subscription model based on the number of registered children. While specific pricing is often opaque and requires a sales consultation, market analysis suggests a starting point of approximately £49 per month for small settings, scaling significantly as enrolment increases.3
* Market Feedback: User reviews consistently praise the intuitive interface but highlight rigidity in financial reporting. The platform’s "one-size-fits-all" approach to invoicing can struggle with the idiosyncratic funding permutations found in some Local Authorities (LAs).4
Connect Childcare: The Enterprise Incumbent
Connect Childcare (encompassing iConnect and ParentZone) serves as the backbone for a substantial portion of the UK’s large nursery chains, claiming a 70% share of the top 25 groups.5
* Core Value Proposition: Stability and comprehensive administrative control. It is designed for multi-site governance, offering granular reporting on occupancy and staff ratios across disparate locations.
* Key Modules: The ecosystem is fragmented into Connect (Head Office Admin), iConnect (Staff Tablets), and ParentZone (Parent Communication). This modular separation allows for deep functionality in areas like "StaffPlan" for rostering and payroll, which is often a paid add-on.6
* Pricing Strategy: A modular pricing architecture where the base system starts around £50/month, but essential add-ons like "iConnect Daily" and "ParentZone" act as cost multipliers. A typical mid-sized nursery may face monthly costs exceeding £125-£150 once necessary modules are activated.6
* Market Feedback: While trusted for its robustness, the user experience is frequently described as "dated" and "slow," with significant friction in navigating between the disparate modules.7 The "enterprise" legacy brings with it a complexity that can overwhelm smaller independent settings.
Blossom Educational: The "Golden Thread" Challenger
Blossom markets itself on the premise of the "Golden Thread"—linking child development observations directly to business outcomes and Ofsted readiness.8
* Core Value Proposition: An "All-in-One" solution that emphasizes Montessori frameworks alongside the standard EYFS curriculum. This specificity appeals to a niche of high-end, pedagogy-focused nurseries.
* Key Modules: It offers strong paperless onboarding capabilities and a "learning journey" tool that integrates heavily with EYFS milestones.
* Pricing Strategy: Transparent, tiered pricing models are a key differentiator. The "Essentials" package begins at £79 per month per site, while the full-feature "Learning" package rises to £149 per month.9
* Market Feedback: Users appreciate the modern interface compared to Connect, but some reviews point to limitations in custom report generation, often requiring manual workarounds for specific data extracts.10
Tapestry: The Learning Journal Specialist
Originally a dedicated pedagogical tool, Tapestry has expanded ‘upwards’ into management features, leveraging its massive user base in the education sector.11
* Core Value Proposition: Unbeatable value for learning tracking. It is the de facto standard for "Learning Journals" in UK primary schools and maintained nurseries.
* Key Modules: Its "Cherry Garden" framework for SEND (Special Educational Needs and Disabilities) tracking is a unique selling point. Recently added features include basic invoicing and registers.
* Pricing Strategy: Extremely aggressive pricing, calculating costs per child per year (approx. £2–£5), which acts as a formidable barrier to entry for new competitors attempting to compete on price alone.12
* Market Feedback: While beloved for educational tracking, its administrative features (billing, occupancy planning) are viewed as rudimentary compared to Famly or Connect.13
1.2 Combined Feature Superset
Analyzing the market leaders reveals a "Superset" of features that constitutes the baseline expectation for any modern NMS. To disrupt this market, a new entrant must deliver the "Commodity" features at near-zero friction while innovating in the "Differentiator" space.


Feature Domain
	Commodity Features (Must Have)
	Differentiators (Premium/Opportunity)
	Administration
	Digital registers, child profiles, emergency contacts, room capacity management.
	Predictive occupancy modelling, multi-site franchise dashboards, AI-driven waitlist optimization.
	Finance
	Invoicing (session/monthly), grant funding calculation (15/30 hours), direct debit integration.
	Automated debt chasing workflows, Tax-Free Childcare (TFC) reconciliation 14, "Split-Bill" logic for separated parents.
	Pedagogy
	EYFS observations, photo/video uploads, "Next Steps" tracking, 2-Year Progress Checks.
	"In the moment" planning tools, Montessori/Curiosity approach toggles, automated end-of-term report generation.
	Communication
	Daily diaries (naps, meals, toileting), in-app messaging, event calendars.
	Real-time translation for ESL parents, community hubs, video-call integration for parent consultations.
	Staffing
	Rota management, qualification tracking (L2/L3), DBS expiry alerts.
	Bank staff management, agency integration, staff well-being tracking, real-time ratio breach alerts.
	1.3 Gaps and Opportunities
Despite the crowded market, structural gaps persist, primarily driven by the inability of legacy platforms to adapt quickly to regulatory shifts and the specific economic pressures of the UK nursery sector.
1. Complexity of "Stretched Funding": A recurring pain point for nursery finance managers is the calculation of the "Stretched Offer"—spreading the government's 38 weeks of funded hours over 51 or 52 weeks. Competitors often rely on manual workarounds or rigid formulas that fail to account for "bank holiday" exclusions or specific Local Authority quirks. A platform with a native, robust "Funding Calculator" that handles 15/30 hours logic with decimal precision (e.g., 11.18 hours/week) represents a significant efficiency upgrade.15
2. The "Paperless" Mirage: While many platforms claim to be paperless, the onboarding process often still involves static PDF downloads or "wet ink" signatures that must be scanned and re-uploaded. A truly digital-first onboarding flow—utilizing dynamic web forms that populate the database directly and legally binding SES (Simple Electronic Signatures)—is a major UX opportunity.17
3. Data Sovereignty and Cost: With rising SaaS costs, nurseries are sensitive to price hikes. Competitors relying on expensive cloud primitives (AWS/Azure) pass these costs to the customer. A self-hostable, efficient stack (Linux/PostgreSQL) can offer "Famly-grade" UX at a price point closer to Tapestry, disrupting the value equation.
4. Safeguarding Audit Trails: Current platforms often bury safeguarding logs within general notes. A dedicated, immutable "Safeguarding Vault" with restricted access and separate retention policies addresses the growing scrutiny from Ofsted regarding child protection.18
2. UK Compliance and Operational Requirements
The operational reality of a UK nursery is governed by a strict mesh of statutory frameworks. A software platform is not merely a utility but a compliance engine; failure to adhere to these rules can lead to a nursery being graded "Inadequate" by Ofsted or facing legal action from the ICO.
2.1 EYFS Statutory Framework (2024 Updates)
The Statutory Framework for the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) sets the standards for learning, development, and care for children from birth to five. The 2024 reforms shifted the emphasis significantly from data generation to professional judgement, aiming to reduce the administrative burden on practitioners.19
Operational Implication: The software must not enforce "tick-box" tracking. Older systems that required practitioners to link every observation to specific "Development Matters" statements are now outdated.
* System Requirement: The platform must support "Flagging" rather than "Tracking." Observations should allow free-text narratives tagged with high-level EYFS areas (e.g., "Physical Development") rather than granular sub-goals.
* The 2-Year Progress Check: A statutory requirement exists for a written summary of a child's development between the ages of 24 and 36 months.21 The system must provide a templated workflow to generate this report, integrating data from recent observations and mandating a section for parental comments before the record is locked.22
2.2 Ofsted Operational Expectations
Ofsted inspections are rigorous and evidence-based. Inspectors will often ask to see "evidence of progress" or "safeguarding logs" on the spot.
* Accident and Incident Logging: The Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 2013 (RIDDOR) and EYFS require detailed logs of any injury.
   * Data Retention: Crucially, accident records for children must be retained until the child reaches the age of 21 years and 3 months (the limitation period for personal injury claims plus a buffer).18 This requirement necessitates a "Long-Term Archive" storage tier in the software, distinct from standard daily logs which might be pruned sooner.
   * Body Maps: Digital accident forms must include a "Body Map" feature—a visual interface where practitioners click to indicate the location of an injury (e.g., "Left Knee").23
* Attendance Tracking: Accurate, tamper-evident logs of arrival and departure times are critical for proving ratio compliance during an investigation. The system must capture the exact timestamp of digital check-ins, not just the "booked session" times.18
2.3 UK GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018
Nurseries process "Special Category Data" (biometrics via photos, health data, ethnicity), requiring the highest standard of data protection.
* Subject Access Requests (SAR): Under UK GDPR, parents have the right to request all data held on their child.
   * System Requirement: A "One-Click SAR Export" feature is essential. This background job must aggregate profile data, daily logs, accident forms, and photos into a portable format (e.g., a ZIP file with CSVs and JPEGs) to ensure the nursery can comply within the statutory one-month timeframe.25
* Right to Erasure vs. Statutory Retention: A complex conflict exists between a parent's "Right to be Forgotten" and the nursery's legal obligation to keep safeguarding records.
   * System Logic: The platform must implement a "Data Lifecycle Manager." When a child leaves, their data enters a "Retention State." Safeguarding and accident logs are locked and retained for the statutory period (up to 25 years for safeguarding), while "soft" data (daily diaries, photos) may be deleted after a configurable period (e.g., 3 years) to comply with data minimization principles.26
* Consent Management: Explicit, granular consent must be recorded for different processing activities (e.g., "Photos for Learning Journal" vs. "Photos for Social Media"). These consents must be revocable at any time via the Parent Portal.27
2.4 Safeguarding and Incident Management
Safeguarding is the single most critical function. The system must support the role of the Designated Safeguarding Lead (DSL).
* Access Control: Safeguarding logs must have a separate permission node (CAN_VIEW_SAFEGUARDING). A standard practitioner should not be able to view confidential concerns regarding a family unless authorized.
* Auditability: Every interaction with a safeguarding record—creation, view, edit—must be logged in an immutable audit_trail table. This audit trail is vital evidence in Serious Case Reviews.18

4. Multi-Tenancy Architecture Options and Recommendation
Selecting the right multi-tenancy strategy is a "one-way door" decision. The architecture must support strict data isolation (critical for GDPR and safeguarding) while adhering to the "zero license cost" constraint, which implies running efficiently on limited hardware resources.
4.1 Comparative Analysis of Architectures
Three primary patterns exist for SaaS data isolation:
Architecture
	Description
	Pros
	Cons
	Security Implication
	Database per Tenant
	Each nursery has a dedicated Postgres instance or separate database file.
	Ultimate Isolation: Physical separation of data. "Right to Erasure" is as simple as deleting a file. Simple backup/restore per tenant.
	Resource Heavy: Running 500 Postgres instances is prohibitively expensive in RAM/CPU. Migration management is a nightmare.
	Very High. Failure in app logic cannot leak data across databases.
	Schema per Tenant
	A single Postgres database contains multiple schemas (namespaces), e.g., nursery_a, nursery_b.
	Balanced: Shared resources but logical separation. Easier migrations than DB-per-tenant.
	Scalability Limits: Postgres handles thousands of schemas poorly (catalog bloat). Connection pooling becomes complex.
	High. Application connects to a specific search_path.
	Row-Level Tenancy (RLS)
	Single database, single schema. All tables have a tenant_id column. RLS policies enforce isolation.
	Efficiency: Highest density; runs on minimal hardware. Zero schema bloat. Easiest CI/CD for migrations.
	Complexity: "Single Tenant Restore" is difficult (requires extracting rows). Developer must ensure RLS is always active.
	High (if RLS is used). Medium (if relying only on WHERE clauses).
	4.2 Recommendation: Row-Level Security (RLS) with PostgreSQL
Selected Strategy: Shared Database, Shared Schema, Row-Level Security (RLS).
Justification: This approach offers the best unit economics for a "Zero License Cost" self-hosted stack. It allows hosting hundreds of small tenants on a single low-cost VPS (e.g., Hetzner Cloud), which is impossible with a DB-per-tenant model. Modern PostgreSQL RLS provides "Deep Defense"—enforcing isolation at the database engine level, not just the application layer.30
Technical Implementation Strategy:
1. Identity Injection: The application middleware (NestJS) identifies the tenant from the JWT or Subdomain. It sets a session variable in the Postgres transaction context before executing any query.
SQL
-- On transaction start
SET app.current_tenant = 'uuid-of-tenant';

2. RLS Policies: Every table is protected by a policy that transparently filters rows.
SQL
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON children
USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant')::uuid);
ALTER TABLE children ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE children FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

3. Super-Admin Access: A special "God Mode" role (for the platform owner) can bypass RLS for cross-tenant analytics, controlled via strict RBAC.
Data Migration and Versioning:
   * Migration Strategy: Using a shared schema means migrations (e.g., adding a column) apply to all tenants instantly. This simplifies DevOps but increases the risk of breaking changes.
   * Mitigation: Use "Expand and Contract" migration patterns. Never rename columns; add new ones, migrate data, then deprecate the old ones.
Backup and Restore:
   * Disaster Recovery: Standard daily pg_dump of the entire database.
   * Single Tenant Restore: This is the trade-off. To restore just Tenant A, we cannot simply restore a file.
   * Solution: Architecture includes a "Shadow Restore" environment. In an emergency, the full backup is restored to the Shadow instance, Tenant A's data is extracted via a script filtering by tenant_id, and then re-inserted into Production.
5. Tech Stack Recommendation (Zero License Cost)
The "Zero License Cost" requirement mandates Open Source (FOSS) components that can be self-hosted on Linux without paid subscriptions.
5.1 Recommended "Default" Stack (TypeScript Ecosystem)
This stack optimizes for developer velocity (sharing types between front/back) and performance.


Layer
	Component
	Choice
	Rationale
	Frontend
	Framework
	Next.js (React)
	Industry standard, excellent performance, vast ecosystem.
	

	UI Components
	Shadcn/UI
	Built on Radix Primitives. "Copy-paste" code ownership means zero vendor lock-in and high accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA).32
	

	State Management
	TanStack Query
	Handles server state, caching, and optimistic updates for the "Daily Feed".
	Backend
	Framework
	NestJS (Node.js)
	Structured, opinionated (Angular-like) architecture. Great for teams. Native support for Microservices.
	

	PDF Generation
	Puppeteer
	Headless Chrome. Essential for rendering pixel-perfect invoices and 2-year checks from HTML templates.33
	Data
	Database
	PostgreSQL 16+
	The only choice for robust RLS. Open Source.
	

	Object Storage
	MinIO
	Self-hosted S3-compatible storage for photos. Eliminates AWS S3 bills.34
	

	Caching
	Redis
	Session store, job queues (BullMQ).
	Auth
	Identity Provider
	Authentik
	Lightweight, open-core, supports multi-tenancy and per-tenant branding ("Brands"). Easier resource footprint than Keycloak.35
	Infrastructure
	Host
	Hetzner Cloud
	Best price/performance in EU (Germany). 1/5th the cost of AWS EC2.36
	

	Proxy
	Caddy
	Automatic HTTPS, simpler config than Nginx.
	5.2 Alternative Stack (Python/Django)
For teams prioritizing stability and "batteries-included" over raw async performance.
   * Backend: Django with django-rest-framework.
   * Why: The Admin interface is auto-generated, saving weeks of dev time. django-tenants is a mature library for schema-per-tenant architecture.37
   * Frontend: React (Vite).
   * Trade-off: Django is synchronous by default (though async is improving). Node.js is generally better suited for real-time features like the "Live Activity Feed" and Chat.
5.3 Security & DevOps Implementation
   * Secrets: managed via Docker Swarm Secrets or HashiCorp Vault (if complexity allows).
   * CI/CD: GitLab CI (Self-hosted) or GitHub Actions (Free tier for public/private repos).
   * Observability: Signoz (Open source APM, traces, logs). A "Zero Cost" Datadog alternative.
6. Paperless Onboarding Design
The onboarding module aims to eliminate the "clipboard and pen" experience for parents.
6.1 Legal Framework: Electronic Signatures
In the UK, under the Electronic Communications Act 2000 and the UK eIDAS regulation, a "Simple Electronic Signature" (SES) is legally admissible for general commercial contracts, including nursery agreements.38
   * Validity Requirement: To be robust in court, the system must create an "Audit Trail" linking the signature to the signatory. This includes capturing the IP address, Timestamp, User Agent, and the email address the magic link was sent to.
6.2 The "Magic Link" Workflow (Wireflow)
   1. Initiation: Nursery Manager enters Parent Email + Child Name in Admin.
   2. Invitation: System sends a transactional email: "Welcome to Sunflower Nursery! Click here to set up your account." (Contains a signed, time-limited JWT).
   3. Account Creation (Step 1): Parent sets a password (or uses Google Social Login via Authentik).
   4. The "Wizard" (Step 2 - Data Capture):
   * Child Info: DoB, Ethnicity, Languages Spoken.
   * Medical: Allergy checklist. Dynamic reveal: If "Allergy = Yes", show text area for "Action Plan".
   * Contacts: Add Emergency Contacts. Validation: Must add at least 2 contacts.
   5. Consent & Policy (Step 3):
   * System renders the Nursery's Policy PDF. Parent must scroll to the bottom to enable the "I have read..." checkbox.
   * Granular Consents: Toggles for "Photos (Internal)", "Photos (Website)", "Outings", "Sun Cream".
   6. Signature (Step 4):
   * Canvas component (react-signature-canvas). Parent draws signature.
   * Action: System takes the signature image + audit metadata -> Stamps it onto the PDF template using pdf-lib -> Saves immutable PDF to MinIO -> Hashes the file for tamper evidence.
   7. Completion: Parent is redirected to the App Dashboard. Manager receives "Onboarding Complete" notification.
7. Pricing and Packaging Model
To succeed, the pricing strategy must undercut expensive incumbents like Famly while covering the operational costs of the self-hosted stack.
7.1 Unit Economics (Cost to Serve)
Leveraging the Hetzner/MinIO stack drastically reduces the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS).
   * Compute (Hetzner): A robust CPX31 instance (4 vCPU, 8GB RAM) costs ~£12/month and can comfortably serve ~50 small tenants with RLS.
   * Storage (MinIO on Block Storage): Hetzner Storage Box or Block Storage costs ~£5 per 1TB.
   * Impact: Photos are the main cost driver. 1TB stores approx 500,000 photos.
   * Marginal Cost per Child: Estimated at <£0.10 per month.
7.2 Proposed Pricing Packages
Package
	Target Audience
	Price Point
	Feature Set
	Starter
	Childminders / Micro (1-10 children)
	£20 / month (Flat)
	Modules A, B, C (Daily Diaries, Registers, Profiles). No Billing.
	Core
	Independent Nurseries
	£1.20 / child / month
	All Starter + Module F (Parent Portal), D (Learning), G (Manual Invoicing).
	Pro
	Established Nurseries
	£1.80 / child / month
	All Core + Module E (Safeguarding), Automated Funding Engine, Occupancy Reports.
	Enterprise
	Multi-site Chains
	Custom
	All Pro + API Access, Dedicated Instance Option, SLA Support, White Labeling.
	   * Competitor Comparison: This pricing is approx. 30-40% cheaper than Famly’s estimated pricing while offering a similar UX, and comparable to Tapestry but with full administrative features.
8. MVP Definition and Roadmap
Objective: Deliver a sellable "Minimum Viable Product" to a closed beta group of 5 nurseries within 8 weeks.
Phase 1: The "Digital Diary" MVP (Weeks 1-8)
   * Goal: Replace paper daily sheets and attendance registers. High stickiness, low financial risk.
   * Scope: Modules A (Core), B (Child), C (Logs), F (Parent Read-Only).
   * Rationale: Nurseries feel the pain of writing daily diaries immediately. Solving this wins staff buy-in. We avoid complex billing logic in the first release to reduce risk of financial errors.
Phase 2: The "Business" Layer (Weeks 9-16)
   * Goal: Allow nurseries to get paid.
   * Scope: Module G (Invoicing V1 - Manual), Module D (Learning - Basic Obs), Module F (Onboarding).
   * Rationale: Once staff are using the app, the Manager will want to consolidate systems.
Phase 3: The "Compliance" Layer (Weeks 17-24)
   * Goal: Replace the Safeguarding binder and spreadsheets.
   * Scope: Module E (Safeguarding/Accidents), Module G (Automated Funding Engine), Module I (Reporting).
9. Data Model and APIs (High Level)
9.1 Key Entities (ERD)
The data model relies on a strict tenant_id foreign key on all entity tables.
   * tenants: uuid (PK), name, subdomain, config_json, created_at.
   * users: uuid (PK), tenant_id (FK), email, password_hash, role (enum), mfa_enabled.
   * children: uuid (PK), tenant_id (FK), first_name, last_name, dob, profile_photo_url, dietary_needs (jsonb).
   * guardians: uuid (PK), tenant_id (FK), user_id (FK - nullable if invited), child_id (FK), is_bill_payer.
   * daily_logs: uuid (PK), tenant_id (FK), child_id (FK), author_id (FK), type (enum: NAPPY, SLEEP, MEAL), timestamp, data (jsonb - e.g. { "result": "WET", "cream": true }).
   * invoices: uuid (PK), tenant_id (FK), guardian_id (FK), amount_pence (int), status (enum), due_date, lines (jsonb).
9.2 API Design (RESTful)
   * Endpoint: GET /api/v1/children
   * Behavior: Returns list of children. Crucial: Middleware automatically appends WHERE tenant_id = current_tenant via RLS.
   * Endpoint: POST /api/v1/children/:id/logs
   * Payload: { "type": "NAPPY", "data": {... } }
   * Permissions: Checked by Casl or similar RBAC guard (must have LOG_CREATE permission).
   * Endpoint: GET /api/v1/funding/forecast
   * Logic: Runs the funding engine calculation to project grant income for the next term based on current occupancy and DOBy (Date of Birth).
10. Risks and Mitigations
Risk Category
	Specific Risk
	Mitigation Strategy
	Safeguarding
	A parent inadvertently sees a photo of another child they shouldn't (e.g., a "Looked After Child").
	"Smart Tagging" Guard: When uploading a group photo, the system checks the "Photo Consent" flag of every tagged child. If any child has "No Consent", the upload is blocked or the face is auto-blurred (future feature).
	Operational
	Tenant restore time. If Tenant A corrupts their data, restoring them affects Tenant B in a shared DB.
	Shadow Restore Protocol: Maintain a standby "Restore Server". Restore the full backup there, extract Tenant A's data using a script, and inject it back into Production.
	Adoption
	Non-technical staff struggling with the UI.
	"Thumb-Zone" Design: UI buttons on tablets must be large and placed in the bottom-right/left corners for one-handed use while holding a child.
	Financial
	Incorrect funding calculation (e.g., Stretched Funding errors) leads to nursery losing money.
	Disclaimer & Override: Clearly label forecasts as estimates. Allow manual override on all generated invoices. Implement a comprehensive unit test suite covering every UK funding edge case.
	Recommended Next Actions
   1. Proof of Concept (PoC): Deploy a "Hello World" NestJS application on a Hetzner Cloud VPS. Configure PostgreSQL with RLS and verify that a user from Tenant A receives a "403/Empty List" when attempting to query Tenant B's data ID.
   2. Compliance Audit: Consult with a UK-based Early Years consultant to validate the "2-Year Check" template and "Accident Form" fields against the very latest 2024/2025 local authority guidance.
   3. Prototype the "Feed": Use Figma to design the mobile view of the Daily Log feed. Test this with real parents to gauge the "delight" factor—this is the primary retention driver.
   4. Legal Template Acquisition: Purchase or commission a standard "Nursery Terms & Conditions" and "Privacy Policy" template that can be whitelabeled and embedded into the Onboarding module for tenants.
